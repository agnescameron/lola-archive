# Alex Kelbert Interview

**Lola Olufemi:** Could you tell me your name and age? How would you describe your creative and/or political and/or intellectual practice? How would you situate your politics?

**Alex Kelbert:** I'm Alex, I'm 30, and I do a bunch of different things. I am one of the organisers in BLMUK, have been since 2015, and was organising in other groups before that. I'm also involved in Wretched of the Earth, which is a radical climate group. I'm also an educator, the last few years that's been my main work --- doing educational work with different kinds of people and different age groups. A lot of that work is around race, gender, and class. I've been trying to work on those things.

I'm assuming that a lot of people you speak to will be people who also have their fingers in many pies/do a lot of different things, which makes it hard to answer your question of trying to locate what we do. It's always hard to make yourself fit in a particular box. But there are some threads that connect everything and they've revealed themselves later. I think a lot in terms of journeys.

**Lola Olufemi:** Could you tell me about journey building a political consciousness? you mentioned that analysis of race, gender and class are prominent in your work. I'm wondering how your politics developed. What were the origin points, if any? I don't really like to talk about origin points, but it's a way of asking how people developed an ability to think critically.

**Alex Kelbert:** As much as it's hard to have one single origin story, I think a lot of people do have something. For me, my dad is French, my mum is Kenyan, and I was born and grew up in France, but when I was a kid, we went back to Kenya once a year. So from a young age I saw lots of different kinds of contexts. When you're young that raises questions about fundamental differences and global inequality; even before you start to think about colonialism, you're struck, "woah, why is this so different". I think that's part of why I've always had a lot of questions around structures/systems --- even before I could actually name those --- and this sense of injustice/unfairness. It took a few years for that to become rooted in actual politics, politics helped frame the more intuitive sense of rage or sense of unfairness and injustice. When I got into university, I started to read about Imperialism, and gained a frame that helped me understand and name things. So that was a lot of my starting point.

Then later in life, beginning to engage with feminist theory. Actually starting from feminist literature and novels before I engaged with theory; reading Middle Class White Women's novels about what it means to be housewife in 1950s US, which somehow I really related to. It's quite funny. So I had my feminist awakening via that, I'm now like...OK.

**Lola Olufemi:** Can you describe what the process of imagining means to you and what its political and social purpose is --- how does it feel, how would you describe what the imagination does for you?

**Alex Kelbert:** A lot of imagination is also around intuition. I remember in maybe 2016, I was outside Yarl's Wood for one of the protests. I was there with Josh, and we were talking about revolution. I must have said something about how it would probably not be in our lifetime, but we'd still be involved and talking about it. And Josh said, "No, definitely in our lifetime", and the way that he was really sure, although I'd been reading revolutionary texts, I'd never heard anyone in my life say out loud that there was revolutionary possibility in our lifetime. In my head I thought, it's totally fine and important to do work that you might not reap the benefits of, but others will. So just to have that said to me, I remember being really shocked, and that was a really important moment for me. I guess that's when you realise that your imagination is also stuck somewhere and then someone says something and you think "woah" --- it's like that meme with the three brains. In that sense there's something about being able to imagine otherwise (now I'm just quoting you) --- and when you do any kind of political organising, you're not just rehearsing that, you're already putting things in place, doing that pre-figurative work.

**Lola Olufemi:** I'm really interested in this idea of pre-configuration in relation to the imagination. Can you recall a memory to do with your organising work that was/is particularly affecting for you in terms of unlocking the imagination, or in terms of making you believe that these things that you enact and rehearse are actually material realities and not just utopic dreams. One thing that always recurs is that the things we desire are positioned as impossible: they are the things that we want that we can't have. I'm interested in how the process and the moment of political organising shifts that for us.

**Alex Kelbert:** That's a hard question because, for me at least, I need to be feeling a particular way. It's quite a positive question, and at the moment I'm just not quite in that space.

**Lola Olufemi:** I understand if you're not in that space, I'd love to hear what space you are in, in terms of that question, feel free to push back on it.

**Alex Kelbert:** It's not necessarily about pushback, just that sometimes there are times that you feel more optimistic and grounded in your work, and sometimes you don't.

In my organising with BLM, when we started back in 2015, we were thinking about the UK context. Part of us beginning to organise here was also about trying to reframe the huge demonstrations for US deaths in custody (which were very important and hugely politicising for loads of people, myself included); and trying to stop the comparative element of "it's not that bad here" --- trying to interrupt that. And so, going with the slogan Black Lives Matter and encountering the negative critiques that were happening in the US, we were thinking about how we make it a space that is for all Black people. So really rehearsing this idea that All Black Lives Matter, and what that means. Even spending that time thinking about who we were talking about and what things are necessary to be able to say "All Black Lives Matter". That work you have to do in your own head, so that you don't forget anyone, so you don't leave anyone out. Which isn't necessarily pre-figurative in itself, but there is something there even in interrupting your own thought processes which mean that you're always leaving people out.

**Lola Olufemi:** When BLM was forming and you were trying combat this comparative element, what was the relationship between the imagination and your political strategy? How were you conceiving of you long and short term goals? I'm really interested in that political moment. How would characterise it and what did you desire?

**Alex Kelbert:** In some ways, the reason that work felt possible was because we knew that people have deep political instincts. Even the focus on the US was coming from a sense of intuition and international solidarity. So there's ways in which you tap into what is already there. I think that's been crucial to a lot of the work that myself and loads of others are doing; you're not just going in to teach and frame, but you're supporting the intuition that's already there and the way in which people already know and the way in which people are kind of already there. I think that's really important. Maybe part of the ups and downs are also around when I feel more or less like that about people's political intuition, and sometimes also my own.

**Lola Olufemi:** And how would you contextualise the political moment in which BLM emerges? It seems to me a moment when different organising groups began to work together; or at least began to share strategy, thinking, like you said about the conditions specific to the place they were in. What was happening politically? No just in terms of death in custody, but the onset of austerity...

**Alex Kelbert:** For me, 2015 wasn't austerity beginning but it was inescapable, just seeing the violence of it. What was really important in those years was building connections and how I think so many of use were really keen to do that. I feel like that's been one of the most promising things in the last few years (even in the last couple years) is that deep urge to always make connections. For me the opposite of connection is competition, so as opposed to saying "no we need to focus on this and not that" focusing on how we connect all those things. I think again it comes from a sense of intuition that these things are deeply connected, and you understand that at the level of your own life, or the lives of your loved ones. It's about that sense of knowledge.

**Lola:** I'm also really interested in experiences of tension, fracture and rupture in political organising. I think that's something that marks any political movement but are always viewed collectively as a kind of failure. We tell the story of the 'rise' and 'fall' of organised movements in a way that makes us stuck -- every analysis of a social movement ends with its dissolution, cooptation or crushing. That way of thinking creates a political impasse that we can't move through. We're constantly thinking about the 'past', how those people organised, and how those conditions don't necessarily exist anymore. So I wondered about your relationship to tension and disruption in relation to the imagination, and how your own political desires have been inflected by specific experiences of it.

**Alex:** I think its complex because you're also asking about time, and the feeling of how we relate to time. In organising, the obvious answer is that none of it is linear, it's not like we do this thing and then we get to that step, and we keep moving up, up up. There are setbacks, there's disruption, you feel like you've gone back to square one. There is always learning, but even with learning it doesn't mean that you're just... you're not just going in circles either, because it can feel like that, it's just....

**Lola Olufemi:** Wiggly lines.

**Alex Kelbert:** Yeah. A bunch of us who've been broadly related to climate activism did an interview a few months ago, specifically around shutting down airports. It was three iterations of different kinds of airport shutdowns: Plane Stupid, the BLM action and the Stansted 15. There are loads of connections between us, and some of the same people. Towards the end there was a question around XR. What was nice about that discussion, was that all of us who were there reflected on the learning and connections that people spent fucking years building. The work of trying to build understanding between different demographics of activists. There's been immense progress in parts of the climate movement because of some of the work that's been put in, and the really hard conversations that have been had. When we were discussing XR, for me (and the others in the discussion) one of the hardest things to witness about XR is how it came up completely distinct from all of the learning and the growth and the connections that have been built over the last few years. They just emerged with that narrative that they're the only ones, that no-one has done this before, and they completely stepped over all of that learning. It was nice that everyone in that conversation felt that way and was able to name that. The way that they've moved into a central position in the mainstream is because of that narrative but there has been a lot of pushback because of the work that's been happening over the years. I think a lot of people have been seeking out some of the gaps and have known where to find other parts of the movement who can avoid those pitfalls.

**Lola:** What marks the organising work that you've done is, as you've said, making the connections between structures that would otherwise be spoken about as distinct: racism as a operative mode for climate emergency. The messaging around the airport shutdowns and other forms of climate based direct action was clear -- our lives are interconnected, the climate emergency is also about racism, it is also about Imperialism, it is also about a colonial legacy. Could you reflect on the hard work of making those connections and how it was related to strategy building?

**Alex Kelbert:** The BLM airport shutdown was our second shutdown in 2016. We did the first one that was blocking major roads and trains and trams in four different cities in the UK, which went really well. People said "ok BLMUK have arrived" and it was fairly well received (obviously some people hated it), overall the media narrative was fairly positive and there was some degree of excitement. Then exactly one month later we did the London City Airport shutdown --- and that was incredibly badly received. Not just by the media or the general population, but also by a lot of older Black activists. That raised a lot of questions around strategy and maybe it wasn't the best thing to do around that time because it alienated a lot of people. I have quite mixed feelings about that; because on the day a lot of activists in Kenya were messaging me and they were saying "finally, we've been wanting/expecting something like this to come from the UK", an action that made an explicit connection to Imperialism. I don't want to erase the fact that it was incredibly well received outside of the UK.

We made a video for the action, and it's one of the things that I'm most proud of. I've done a lot of research work around climate stuff, that's been my bread and butter for 12 years. So when we were making that video, I did a lot of the writing for the script, and really tried to make it clear what the connections are between race and climate chaos --- which to me was obvious because I'd been doing that work for a long time --- but I know that people really struggled to make those connections. When a few of us were trying to do that script, it was a crucial moment that produced a good output. It's been 5 years, and I still have people who email me about the video, and I know the video is still used in trainings. Even though it's 5 years ago it's really done the rounds in a lot of climate spaces including the biggest NGOs because we did what they'd been incapable of doing. That goes to your question about temporality --- that's an artefact from 5 years ago and its still used in the present for training and to guide future work.

But you also asked about strategy and there's a question there around whether it was strategic to do it then. Arguably not, loads of people feel like it wasn't. But (because we're talking about time and how that works) it also feels like it was, because it's part of that wiggly line of how we move and how we progress, and at that time (at least for me and a number of others in the organisation and the other groups that made that possible) that's where we were at. I don't want to sound like I think we're this vanguard organisation, but there was definitely a sense that people weren't ready for that.

**Lola:** You created a kind of opening...

**Alex:** I think we did create an opening. It's hard when we have those narratives around the present and the future and if people are ready, and even calling it an opening. I think my biggest understandings of climate emergency comes from the fact that half of my family lives in East Africa and climate chaos there didn't start 2 years ago. When I was growing up in the early 90s there were already droughts in most of East Africa. A lot of communities will have a deep-rooted understanding of the things we were doing in the action. I think it just showed some of the disconnects within different parts of the Black community...

**Lola:** I think that's precisely it, when you're pointing to that video as evidence of this artefact, its also in a way --- I don't want to say snapshot, that seems too reductive --- but it is this capsule of a specific kind of imagination that the present enables you to reflect on.

**Alex:** I think you calling it a capsule --- it was exactly that. It's true that it looked completely out of place, which is why there was all that pushback, because it didn't "fit", but it did. I don't necessarily think if we were to do that action today that it would work. Well, we literally couldn't do that action today; just now thinking about the literal logistical impossibility of shutting down an airport right now. It had to happen then and didn't really that know then. We were acting out of a sense of, this is just what we're doing.

**Lola:** That kind of imagination and the dissemination of it is always collective; it's made possible, recognised or witnessed precisely because it's shared with others. In the making of the video and capsule together... that's precisely the location of the imagination, in a collaborative framework.

Could you say more about how it would not be logistically impossible to do a shutdown today and why that is?

**Alex:** It's about the criminalisation of activism, and now the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill is democratising that criminalisation across all forms of activism. But specific airport stuff has been massively criminalised, even before the Bill. Even in 2015 we had other people shut down the airport for us, because there was no way we would have had Black men with beards run across an airport. And now, I don't know if it would be possible to have White middle class people running across an airfield.

**Lola:** I wondered if you could tell me about your relationship to words like feminism, anti-racism and blackness specially in terms of what you understand those words/concepts to mean, and how they have been significant in your organising practice and your intellectual work.

**Alex:** Feminism is a funny one for me, because it came to me later when I was in my mid-twenties, or maybe a bit younger. On a personal level, because I grew up in a completely white area, I was always way more aware of my race. It was only when I moved to London that I got an understanding of my own gender, my own sexuality, and so that's when I started to think about gender, think about feminism. I think it's not uncommon for Black women/Black people to have a complex relationship with feminism, like what I was saying earlier about reading these novels about 1950s White, privileged, American women, and navigating that with some degree of difficulty. But there is something important to me about seeking out common humanity -- that's always been an important thing for me. My mum is very Christian, so I grew up going to Church. There are obviously some bad bits but because of this, it's always been necessary to me to think about others and how I relate to others -- trying to be generous and open-hearted. In a way, that sounds weird, but I guess stuff you learn from when you're young does guide your practice.

To answer about feminism, racism and anti-blackness; I think anti-racism, for me, is easier and less controversial than feminism. But with Blackness I think it's complicated because in the last few years there's also been quite, for me, semi-dispiriting ways of using Blackness as a way to exclude and as a way to narrow-down political visions and political imagination, and creating and fostering difference. Not just difference, but...I don't know. I don't know what it is.

**Lola:** I think you're touching on something that's incredibly complicated. In speaking to other people I've realised this question is kind of a trap, because there are no singular definitions of these concepts and everybody's responses are underpinned by a desire for collective being...

**Alex:** but it depends because I would argue that there isn't agreement, and that's one of the biggest things in the movement right now, is that kind of tension. And it's quite deep because it's hard. When you ask Black people about Blackness, part of the answer has got to be a personal one around what we need from Blackness. It can be a kind of blanket, not in a bad way, but it defines you, and it holds you, and it shapes so much of us, or me. But it's also complicated, and thinking about race as a structure and complicating race and rejecting the rigidity of that framing...

**Lola:** And essentialism right? Because I think often people's personal relationships to Blackness are named as essentialist, but what they are actual expressing is a personal relationship to being a racialised person.

**Alex:** And that's really important, and I think we need to keep that space open to be able to reflect and think about what defines you, what defined you.

**Lola:** And most importantly, what defines you in the eyes of others.

**Alex:** In the eyes of others, but also of yourself. And that's what I mean about the blanket. It is really important to get a sense of yourself. It gives you a sense of protection, but it can also be tricky and it can also be dangerous. The essentialism is bad in the sense that it excludes people from that frame, but it also prevents us from seeing common humanity. What's interesting about saying stuff like that, is because historically people have tried to erase difference (trying to build commonality by pretending like there isn't difference), it's also about what is the value that you ascribe to difference. What power do you give it?

**Lola:** And also how do you mediate between those two things. The discussions around these concepts often become incredibly polarised in ways that I find strange because both conceptualisations can be true, one theoretically, one affectively. Both things can be enacted. As we've seen often, uncritical essentialism isn't helpful in building political strategy --- precisely because it excludes where we need many hands.

**Alex:** But it also is about what's strategic. If we need more people, why should we close doors? Who are we building a future for? Who do we imagine in the future? As people who may not figure in other people's futures, we need to think quite carefully about the futures that we imagine and who's in them.

**Lola:** Absolutely. That's a powerful imaginative act. And I think one purpose of the imagination is how it can help us think through the limits of the body. Which is precisely how I think about these concepts, as methodologies, ways that we can escape the traps that have been placed on us by others.

I wondered also if you could reflect on ideas of freedom/liberation/revolution, and the role of the imagination in those concepts, particularly thinking about how your work is informed by a legacy of liberatory practice and how this legacy is continued in your own political imagination. You don't have to do all three, you can pick one that resonates most with you.

**Alex:** It goes back to what I was saying about hearing for the first time that revolution might happen in our lifetime. And bringing something like revolution or liberation into the realm of the possible, as opposed to the realm of what's right but is not something that's meant to be tangible. That process of bringing it into the realm of the tangible.

There are different ways of answering that. There's a way of breaking it in to chunks and enacting bits of it now. And then there's a constant practice of thinking and imagining and that feedback loop between what you think about and imagine, and what you try to bring to life. That's hard because then you're also confronted with the setbacks of everything that's working against liberation, that's working against freedom, and that's obviously working against revolution: very practical things like Laws, and pandemics that are used for nationalistic purposes. And so, there's an element --- not an element of discipline --- but of trust that there is a reason why you keep dreaming or seeking or picking out specific books that do that.

**Lola:** It's important to ask yourself why do you return there, why do you return to a particular idea or concept.

One of the key concepts in my research is analysing the value of cultural production in liberatory struggle.. I wondered what you understand by the term cultural producer, and if you see yourself as that or if you see the work that you do as a kind of cultural production.

**Alex:** I have never described myself as a cultural producer, I might organise with people who do, and usually I'd be like: oh yeah this other person does it. I guess so much of the organising work we've been doing has been the work of cultural production. I've never really thought about the terms. If we understand that the realm of culture is really fundamental to any political work (it's not distinct, or an add-on, it's not that part of the strategy needs to address culture but it's actually all part of the same thing) then obviously cultural production is a huge part of what we do. Even going back to that video, that's a way of engaging in cultural production: by putting visuals and putting words and putting frames, and throwing that somewhere and seeing what comes back, seeing where it resonates. So much of it is produced with audiences; the fact that the message got picked up far away and people messaged me on twitter from Kenya being like "Yo that was sick" --- for me that's part of that cultural feedback loop. But it also feeds you, the cultural production of others will also feed into your political organising. That's what I mean about having specific books that speak to me in a particular way, and that informs everything.

**Lola:** It's interesting because, I'm thinking about arguing that the term cultural producer is at risk of being stolen by neoliberalism: the cultural producer emerges in this environment as a singular person abstracted from a community who makes work that is then commented on in culture. I'm really wondering what it would mean to think of people on the street who make music, or political organisers also as cultural producers; not in the sense of the revered individual but as people who make things in collective spaces, and what that means.

I wanted to also ask about this idea of temporality; what your own personal relationship to time is in the work that you've done, but also if you can visualise time. I know you've said spirals, but I'm really interested if you could elaborate on that a little bit. What does time look/sound/smell/taste like? A lot of trying to define concepts that can't be defined (like the imagination or time) feels to me like grasping, and that's going to be a core part of my writing: this thing of trying to put your finger on it but you can't really.

**Alex:** Grasping makes sense. For me, it's also the feeling of looking back and seeing that actually, it was always there. Sometimes you feel like you're doing nothing, and then you'll do something and realise it was all happening; the future was already in the past and then in the present moment you look back and you're like "oh". It's a sense of --- its not really surprise --- but suddenly you realise that time is also working with you.

**Lola:** In situating yourself in a political legacy, which thinkers/people/work sustains yours? I don't say this to valorise specific individuals, but it comes from that desire to know more about how people's political consciousness has developed and where they find that desire for more.

**Alex:** There are loads of people, both in the past and people who are doing stuff now. Going back to the temporality question, for me reading about the work of Claudia Jones for example, is both like reading about someone who was organising in the past but it also feels like it really speaks to my present. So trying to write about intersectionality and then reading that, it's not the same, but it also is. There are different names, there are different ways of describing the same thing. Being able to see all those loops and also just thinking back to this phenomenal woman who was so high up in the US Communist Party, and the specific work that she was doing. To me it sounds like she was taking the Cadres and shaking them, and saying "this is what we need to be doing, what the fuck are you doing". To read about that and to sense her energy and anger and drive, to me seems very present and very contemporary.

There's loads of different things, but it's quite hard to think about archives because I'm so aware of what's not in the archives. At the Mwasi collective festival in Paris, they were reading from [name of the pamphlet] --- a pamphlet written in the 1970s. I'd never heard of any Black women organising in France; so to suddenly have this pamphlet was really nice, it was a beautiful moment. It was so sick and really radical, and it's amazing to know that that was there. But it also acts as a reminder of all the times where nothing has survived, there is no pamphlet we can read, there's no trace in that tangible way. And there might be traces in other ways, but there also might not be. I think that can be hard.

**Lola:** How do you contend with histories that do not appear in the state tomb that is the archive? How do you contend with the fact you belong to a history of things that have been lost or misplaced, or that you won't be able to find and make that connection to?

**Alex:** Or hidden or destroyed.

**Lola:** And there's such a desire to have the full story, to understand History in its totality and (as as we've said) we are not even featured in the histories that are being constructed at this moment, even as we are alive. So people feel doubly injured. It's that double loss of: we don't know the past, but we're also not being 'archived' properly in the present.

To segue quite seamlessly into the question of archives, I wondered if you could reflect on your relationship to the archive, and what impact the archive (or past material in any way that you understand it) has had on your political strategy, or the political strategy of the groups you have been a part of?

**Alex:** I did an oral history project with a friend of mine who's also involved in BLM and other groups. We've been trying to interview primarily Black women who were involved in activism any time between the 60s and 80s or even 90s. When it comes to Political Blackness there are obviously big camps, and especially what is written today is really anti, and what was written then was really pro --- until it wasn't. But there's very little about the critiques of it at the time. I say that as someone who is very attached to it and I think it's really important and I think it's complicated. I'm not necessarily there to feed the antis, I'm just there to understand; what were the conflicts at the time, what were the tensions already at the time, because so much of that has already been erased. We're trying to interview people just to get a sense of that.

We would try to read and find the footnotes. I went to the BCA and was listening to all these stories where specific names would be mentioned, and then I'd try to find out about them specifically.

There are very few collectives who got to write their own stories. Even when you look at those that were published, you might see in a footnote a brief mention of the split in SBS when some of the Black women formed something else --- which was never named, making it really hard to find. We're trying to do that work, to try and understand what was going on at the time --- the tensions and how some of it got resolved, or didn't. Not necessarily with a specific agenda in mind for today but just to give it the complexity that it requires.

**Lola:** On the question of archives, I'm really interested in the value of gossip. I went to see Stella Dadzie's papers at the BCA and it struck me --- how much paper she'd kept number one --- but also how many fights there were, that you wouldn't know about if you hadn't engaged with those documents. I was piecing together these arguments about a Women's Centre, and there were all these letters, and all of these familiar names. I think gossip is an underhand way that capital H History is disseminated. But I'm interested in your relationship to that, especially as we are more aware of one another in the present moment, information circulates publicly now where maybe it was once private.

**Alex:** Gossip is an important source of information; and information in the most complex way, not just circulation of truth but circulation of a kind of knowledge, which can also be complicated and made more complex. I think it's important as a kind of knowledge, but it's hard when that's all that there is. Thinking about the present moment, the public-ness of gossip can also make you more self-aware in a bad way. It can make you less likely to try, or less likely to have conflict, you might have to be more careful with who you have beef with; and I think beef can be really productive sometimes or just having a sense of clarity especially around political vision.

**Lola:** I agree, people need to fight more, but fight in ways that are constructive. Tension needn't be this thing that we attempt to avoid to create a happy narrative of this political moment, because it's marked by so many differing and competing desires.

**Alex:** But being clear about your disagreements. Often there's a sense that we can all agree, but I know that we actually don't all agree.

**Lola:** To round-up, I'm interested in your understanding of what effect the imagination can have on our emotions and our emotional landscape and the importance of that. There is often a split (which I don't really understand) between a rigid and materialist politics for whom identity, emotion, desire, yearning are unimportant things, and affect is banished to the 'identitarians.' What I'm trying to argue in this piece of research is that both inform each other in a really crucial way. The impetus to act comes from an imaginative impulse. So, I'm wondering what the role of the imagination in regard to your own emotional landscape has been.

**Alex:** I think you said it really well when you said that the impetus to act comes from that. One of the first things I ever wrote publicly was (in 2015 or something) for valentine's day that was a piece trying to talk about love as a political thing, love that comes from a sense of rage, and the connection between rage and love and how that can be the biggest driver. It probably is very cringe, but I think it's one of the most truthful things I've ever written. It was reflecting on why I organise, which goes back to what we were saying at the beginning about trying to look for a sense of humanity. Especially in a context where there is so much dehumanising; which is probably why I am always keen to do the reverse; to re-humanising not just of myself and of my community but of everyone. It's also that question of who figures in the future we want to imagine. For me that's got to be the biggest driving force, or impetus to act.

**Lola:** What is the role of experimentation in your work in relation to the archive? Do you think an experimental approach to the archive might help us deal with all of these problems that we're talking about; about official histories, about temporality, about our understanding of ourselves in relation to others? And separate from that what are the kinds of experiments you have enacted in your cultural production?

**Alex:** I feel like sometimes we don't get to be experimental because of how much scrutiny there is on everything being perfect and thought through and it needs to be part of a strategy. Maybe that's just a reflection of the last couple years where some of the work that I've been a part of has been incredibly scrutinised, which makes experimentation less likely. You're less likely to take risks when you're being watched without grace. Obviously I'm just very wounded.

That sense of knowing there are gaps and you have to take liberties to fill those gaps is how we have to move. So in that oral history project we're doing, we have no idea where to look for the stuff that we don't know we're looking for. So we're just going to ask people, tap in to gossip, look in footnotes, do all sorts of random things, and read how different people have tried to do that; and you just make your own methods.

**Lola:** and you see what emerges.

**Alex:** And sometimes it doesn't and sometimes it does.
